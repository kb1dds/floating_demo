# floating_demo
Simple demonstrations of floating point

* `FLTDEC.FOR` : Convert floating point to storage representation (FORTRAN IV)
* `FLTDEC.SAV` : RT-11 executable 
* `FLTDCC.C` : Convert floating point to storage representation (ANSI C)
* `FLTDCC.SAV` : RT-11 executable 
* `UNDFLW.FOR` : Demonstrate underflow by repeatedly dividing 1 by 2 (FORTRAN IV) 
* `UNDFLW.SAV` : RT-11 executable
* `UNDFLC.C` : Demonstrate underflow by repeatedly dividing 1 by 2 (ANSI C) 
* `UNDFLC.SAV` : RT-11 executable

Note: executables from the C versions can be obtained via `gcc <file.c> -o <file>`.
